<h2>A Crash Course on Web Security for The Beginner</h2>
<h3>20th November 2023</h3>

<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Security is hard for those that do it, and even more so for those that are looking to make a start in breaking and
    defending systems for the good of themselves and others. There are a ton of resources online about how to
    generically break into cybersecurity, however I wanted to switch it up and write a brief essay around getting into
    web application security! With this getting right into DeTaIlS</p>

<p>Being the critical thinker you are, I bet you are asking <i>"Well, why should I follow such a specific area of
        cybersecurity?"</i>. That's a great question, and you should feel great for asking such a question. My reasons
    in response are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The more niche we make this path, the more prescriptive we can make it for the beginner.</li>
    <li>Web application security is a large part of red teaming. With a large percentage of CTFs/Engagements/Bounties
        being webapp based.</li>
    <li>By being so niche, it can be quicker building up to practical proficiency, this can be fantastic in boosted
        confidence by getting a quicker return on value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have the what and why, behold the following table of contents that will guide you down the path of good
    webapp-ing. If you can consume and understand all of the following resources, you will have enough knowledge to say
    you can security test websites at a semi-professional level.</p>

<h3 id="section1">Understanding How The Web Works</h3>
<p>Okay so let's get real top level on you, and think about how this whole web and websites thing came to be. The start
    date for the internet (i.e., The Web) has a number of dates however it was invented by a lot of people included a
    Tim Berners-Lee and the official birthday of the internet is 1983 (we are skipping shit with the Cold War, CERN,
    etc.).</p>
<img src="../images/tim.jpg" />

<p>Fast forward a bunch and boom! <b>Internet!</b> So now we have a bunch of computers:</p>
<img src="../images/computer.png" />
<p>Which are connected to to one another and more importantly to servers, which are bigger computers that server up
    websites via the HTTP protocol:</p>
<img src="../images/Client-server-model.svg.png" />

<p>Now that server might be in another country, or the same country through luck or the use of a <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/">CDN</a>. Some things that generally happen is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>You will use a browser to view websites and jam in the address or look one up for a site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>There is a technology called DNS which stands for Domain Name Service. This takes a domain name and converts
            it to an IP address</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The website <i>https://tryhackme.com</i> will get converted to an address of a server thanks to DNS.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This IP could be a Web Application Firewall, The web server directly, a proxy, CDN, either way it gets you to
            the front door of the site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Your web requests and responses got from one end to the other thanks to TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, and even something
            called BGP. BGP will route from internet router to internet router to get the packet from client to server!
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Want to see an internet?! Open up your command prompt/terminal/whatever (google this step if you don't know) and run
    the following command: <code></code></p>
<img src="../images/tracert-color-coded.png">

<p>This is enough for knowing how the internet works, however feel free to look more into this.</p>

<h3 id="section2">Understanding How The Websites Work</h3>
<p>Okay so now the meat of the matter. Usually a website can range from a very thing (like this site which is HTML and
    one line
    of CSS), or something written with authentication, authorisation, frontend features, integrations,
    tracking, and more.</p>

<p>Usually the things that are used to build a website are known as a Tech Stack, I'll enlist the expertise of Jeff
    Delaney
    as you watch this lovely little 11 minute 19 second video on Tech Stacks</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Sxxw3qtb3_g?si=RtHDsLTxJyUNIRYv"
    title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Now that you know what tech stacks are, and roughly how websites are built (at least at an architectural level a
    little bit). We should talk about HTTP methods.</p>

<p> So before we did talk about that fact that the HTTP protocol is paramount in running websites (should be a giveaway
    in the URL). There are a number of methods in HTTP called GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH and maybe one or two others I am
    forgetting about.</p>

<p>When I make a request to a web server, I will use a method like let's say POST (usually used to edit something). I'll
    put in the URL I am making the request to. I might also have some HTTP headers which are key value pairs of info
    like I might have one for authentication like <code>token: jaslkdfjalkfsjdscd</code> that proves the request is me.
    Finally I will have HTTP body information that has what I am submitting.</p>

<img src="../images/HTTP_RequestMessageExample.png" />

<p>Now your message can return with 200 okay, 404 not found, or whatever with information on the page load. In essence
    this is how all websites work.</p>

<p>A core thing we should also mention is browsers. Browsers pay an important part about the website thing and the
    security thing. Browsers can be intercepted to allow us to modify the request of the website, we can use development
    tools in the browser, etc. As a security person <b>IT IS VITAL THAT YOU TEST WEBSITES PAST JUST THE BROWSER</b>.</p>

<p>Oh another thing that might be obvious as well unless you're a bit of a dumb dumb is that websites don't work on a
    single page (there are some exceptions called Single Page Applications), however let's not get into that, usually
    when you have a URL you have the first part telling you whether it is HTTP or secure HTTP <i>https://</i>, after
    this is the domain name <i>cool.website.com</i> (note: The <i>cool</i> part is a subdomain off the website.com
    domain), and then you will have a subdirectory like <i>/book</i> and then you might have a thing called a URL
    parameter which is an piece of information about a thing for the site <i>?bookId=1337</i>. Put this together and you
    have a pretty complex and neat website URL <i>https://cool.website.com/book?bookId=1337</i>.
</p>

<p>Let's go to the Auckland Library and key in a book</p>
<img src="../images/auckland_library.png" />

<p>Using the paragraph above, you can detect this, and also notice some website options can be set in the URL. What if I
    wanted to return double the amount of books on the page? What was I searching? So much information can be discovered
    by the URL itself.</p>

<p>Now one thing I didn't mention is URL encoding, so when you send a request, some special characters are important
    (i.e., &). Improper encoding can lead to security vulns, or the request not being sent properly.</p>

<p>As you can see on the above, the URL parameter has an <i>&</i> character to spread out the URL parameters, so what if
    we try searching for '&&&'?</p>

<img src="../images/auckland_library2.png">

<p>As you can see here, the URL parameter is encoded as <i>%26</i> which is URL encoding. Base64 is something you'll
    also encounter as an encoding method during your travels however just think of encoding as that thing that helps the
    browser and client send data better-er between one another. Good websites will hide away the encoding to the
    normies, and you'll only ever see it if you intercept requests or view the URL when a thing is being encoded there.
</p>

<p>Okay so to drive down at least some very basic things about how websites work, I have the following videos from
    ByteByteGo to give you. Give them a watch, and then with this out of the way, let's get into the web vulnerabilities
    section.</p>

<h3 id="section3">Understanding The Common Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Most web applications have the same things, are built a complex stack, and are made by fallible people. It is no
    surprise then that web applications naturally have common vulnerabilities that come up time and again.</p>

<p>Now most people will start you on the classic OWASP Top 10, you can and should Google that however nay, we are going
    to go through something which in my opinion is better-er! And this is the <a
        href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html">CWE - Software Development List</a>.</p>

<p>If you visit the website, it'll be worth noting that this isn't just for web software, however if you expand on
    things. You'll find more than just injection as weakness, let's say you go into <i>Data Neutralization Issues -
        (137)</i> you'll find a trove of areas to test</p>

<img src="../images/CWE.png" />

<p>As you can see, you can find a lot more than a more simplistic table of ten vulns. With a bit of reading and
    understanding you'll have a whole trove of things up your sleave to do. For instance going into. For example going
    up onto <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html">CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web
        Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')</a>
</p>

<img src="../images/CWE-XSS.png" />

<p>This page will give you POCs, OWASP references, relevant publications, and more. This can be a real life saver when
    you are looking at things to get into.</p>

<p>For a quick note on web application vulnerabilities, although the list can be very large and daunting, there are a
    number of very common vulnerabilities that are seen throughout the internet in 2023, although the OWASP 10 will have
    you convinced that their list is the defacto, I want to break down what I have experienced myself as three things
    the beginner can test and look out for, in order:</p>

<ol>Three easy and common web application vulnerabilities:
    <li><b>Broken Access Control:</b> This occurs when you have a login for a website (Authentication), and those login
        accounts can do different things (Authorisation) depending on the account that you are logged into. For
        instance, if there are admin and standard users to an application, you might want to play around with an admin
        account, and then try to repeat the requests for those actions while logged into the standard user account
        (remember earlier how we talked about manipulating requests, and not working with only the frontend on the
        browser). You'd be surprised at how many times an admin feature just checks for a logged in session, and not
        specifically on if the user making the admin-related request is indeed an admin. This problem only gets worse
        with the complexity of the application (more roles more problems).</li>
    <li><b>Cross-site Scripting:</b> Cross-site Scripting is where a URL parameter (like we saw before), or information
        sent in a request is reflected back to the web application and is interpreted as Javascript code. For older web
        application technology, it is common to see an input consisting of <code>'/()";</code> characters and the like
        being reflected back as code instead of text if formatted properly. This allows hackers to inject code and do
        malicious things like redirect the user to a phishing page, steal cookies, and make the user do another request.
    </li>
    <li><b>Logical Errors:</b> This one is hard to categorise, however there is an area of vulnerability where the
        inherent design of functionality may be not so well thought out. Let's say for a shopping app, if they forget to
        have a <i>One coupon per cart</i> rule, one could submit multiple 5% off coupons and get the item for pennies on
        the dollar. This example is contrived however for trading applications, gambling sites, market apps, and
        anything with a complex or contrived flow, doing this sort of hacking where the requests and order can be
        chopped and changed around could prove to expose very interesting functionality where the useability of the
        application and what it does is being used to undermine the application.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have a list of ways on how you can pwn a website, how websites work from a basic understanding and where
    they came from. Let's cap this crash course out with learning about the tools you might need to PWN a website, and
    where you can learn website hacking.</p>

<h3 id="section4">Understanding Web Application Hacking Tools and Where to Practice</h3>
<p>Congratulations if you have read through this far, you're doing awesome and you should feel awesome. Now that you
    have the basics down and know a few basic hacks, let's tool about getting you some cyber weapons and a range to fire
    . The first thing you want is a web application proxy attack tool. The defacto standard is Burp Suite by Portswigger
    which can be found <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload">HERE.</a> The other contender for the
    start of your journey is the more open source, less popular, but equally as valid OWASP ZAP, or Zed Attack Proxy,
    which can be found <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/">HERE.</a> There are lots of web application security scanners
    however these tools are great to start off with instead of using a whole suite of tools due to these proxy attack
    tools being able to enable you do to multiple things like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scan a website for vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Manipulate HTTP requests</li>
    <li>Look for directories</li>
    <li>Make attacks like brute forcing easier</li>
    <li>Keep a log of your attack on a website for you to look back on (obviously not for the victim to view).</li>
</ul>
<img src="../images/ZAP.png" />
<p>As you can see, the tools can be rather complex. I won't describe how to use Burp Suite's Repeater, or discuss how to
    look at the ZAP Cockpit, or Bambda's, Turbo Intruder, etc. etc. That part I'll leave to the next place, the bootcamp
    that you will learn a few attacks and go from there.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security">Portswigger Web Security Academy</a> is made by the same people
    that created the Burp Suite tool. Here you can create a free account. And from here I recommend going through and
    looking at topics, learning paths, and overall exploring vulnerabilities we discussed previously.</p>

<p>It should be noted that although they will say that you need to have a Professional Burp Suite license, this is far
    from the truth. It is entirely possible to do the labs without a pro copy (or at least looking at the 150-ish labs
    I've done on it). The trick is to expand out of the cookie cutter solutions and to think about how you could perform
    the same attack with different tools like ZAP, HTTPDump, JWT Tool, and others.</p>

<img src="../images/portswig.png" />

<p>Now, if you have gotten to this part. I just want to let you know that you are in the 1% of people when it comes to
    understanding how web security works. Congratulations! Now go forth and find some vulnerabilities, you'd be amazed
    at what you find!</p>
