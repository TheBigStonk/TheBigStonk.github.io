<h2>CodeQL for SAST - An Introduction</h2>
<h3>13th November 2024</h3>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>As part of a desire to add another tool to my belt in regards to secure code review, I looked to explore CodeQL. Developed by GitHub and first released to the public around 2020, CodeQL is a "Semantic code analysis engine" that allows you to run SQL-like queries for certain code patterns across a large repository to find bugs.</p>

<p>The beauty of this tool is the freemium model where it's all free if you are running this across public repos. If you are a company however, you can't take this for free, you got to get the GitHub advanced security tack-on.</p>

<h3>Walkthrough on Setup</h3>

<p>So the best place to start is at the intended beginning. Visit <a href="https://codeql.github.com">https://codeql.github.com</a> and read the page top to bottom.</p>

<p>One thing to quickly add is that right before getting stuck in, CodeQL isn't good at everything. Snyk/Sonarqube is good at overall code security and posture identification, CodeQL is good for targeted queries, Trufflehog for secrets scanning, Dependabot for packages, etc. (even semgrep could do a lot of what CodeQL does) For a full list of SAST goodness, visit <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools">https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools</a>.</p>

<p>By any means, we start by downloading the Visual Studio Code extension as highlighted within the marketing page.</p>

<img src="../images/codeql_brochureware.png"/>

<p>After this, we go through and check we have CodeQL installed properly as an extension, this includes running <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code> and check that the commands are properly set up.</p>

<img src="../images/codeql_extension.png"/>

<p>Finally before we get started with CodeQL properly using the CodeQL tutorial at <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/ql-tutorials/">https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/ql-tutorials/</a>, we are going to want to install the CodeQL CLI via the CodeQL bundle at <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases</a>, making sure to pull in and install the latest <code>tar.gz</code>. It's worth noting that in the release page there are CodeQL actions and bundles. Make sure you're installing the bundle for your platform. I know it's confusing as hell. Go to the releases for <b>codeql-action</b> and scroll down until you see bundle...</p>

<img src="../images/codeql_bundle.png"/>

<p>Once the bundle is installed, proceed to open up a terminal and put it in an appropriate directory to extract and call the CodeQL CLI from.</p>

<img src="../images/codeql_cli.png"/>

<p>As you can see, we have CodeQL CLI executing properly, so now we should just add <code>/Users/haze/Code/codeql</code> to our PATH so we can create CodeQL databases and execute queries from wherever (i.e., a repo we are security assessing).</p>

<img src="../images/mac_path.png"/>

<p>We are now at a stage where we have a basic understanding of CodeQL, we have the VS Code extension installed, and the CLI loaded up on our test device, now let's follow through the tutorial on</p>

<h3>Tutorial Hell - Finding a Thief</h3>
<p>So we'll now start up on the tutorial <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/find-the-thief/">https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/find-the-thief/</a> and it's subsequent partners, but instead of doing this as an online GitHub codespace we will clone the <a href="https://github.com/github/codespaces-codeql">https://github.com/github/codespaces-codeql</a> repo these tutorials are based on with <code>git clone https://github.com/github/codespaces-codeql.git</code></p>

<p>So the thing is that the thief is among the data to query, and as such you have a bunch of yes/no questions and answers:</p>

<img src="../images/thief_criteria.png"/>

<p>What are we querying exactly? well we're searching the CSV in <code>/codespaces-codeql/.tours/codeql-tutorial-database</code> in which you might need to rename <code>.tours</code> to <code>tours</code> to potentially get the searching working properly to import the database to query from.</p>

<img src="../images/codeql_vscode.png"/>

<p>After this, we will run <code>/Users/haze/Code/codespaces-codeql/tutorial-queries/tutorial.ql</code> using the tutorial import to bring in that library and run predicates. To find out more about libraries and predicates please view <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/find-the-thief/#ql-libraries">https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/find-the-thief/#ql-libraries</a> For now we'll run the base query of:</p>
<samp>
    import tutorial<br>
    from Person p<br>
    select p
</samp>

<p>and see what is returned:</p>
<img src="../images/codeQL_query_results.png"/>

<h3>Making more specific queries and catching our thief</h3>
<p>Okay so that is working with 116 suspects returned, now let's query all the users using the height query predicate in order to see if we can cut that list down. The query will be adjusted to only return people with height over 150cm. What's great about CodeQL is predicates are set to autocomplete within the CLI</p>

<img src="../images/thief_getHeight.png"/>
<p>Our query is now:</p>

<samp>
    import tutorial<br>
    <br>
    from Person p<br>
    where p.getHeight() > 150<br>
    select p        
</samp>

<p>Running it we get the following:</p>
<img src="../images/77_results.png"/>
<p>Okay we cut out 39 people with this adjustment alone, following the rest of the tutorial will give us our thief. Before we finish this out with a suspect, although we are shown use of the `exists`
    keyword, we can also enhance results with variables concatenated together to return more information about people, for example:</p>

<samp>
    import tutorial<br>
    <br>
    from Person p, string c<br>
    where p.getHeight() > 150 and<br>
    not p.getHairColor() = "blond" and<br>
    p.getHairColor() = c<br>
    <br>
    select p + " who has the colour hair: " + c
</samp>

<p>Will return:</p>
<img src="../images/hair_colour.png"/>

<p>Okay, now to cap off the tutorial with a shorted query of:</p>

<samp>
    import tutorial<br>
    <br>
    from Person p<br>
    where p.getHeight() > 150 and<br>
    exists (string c | p.getHairColor() = c) and<br>
    p.getHairColor() = ["black", "brown"] and <br>
    not (p.getHeight() > 180 and p.getHeight() < 190) and <br>
    not p.getAge() = max(int i | exists(Person t | t.getAge() = i) |i) and<br>
    p.getHeight() < avg(int i | exists(Person t | t.getHeight() = i) | i) and<br>
    p = max(Person t | t.getLocation() = "east" | t order by t.getAge())<br>
    select "The culprit we will put to death is " + p<br>
</samp>

<p>To find *Hester* is the culprit. One thing my query has that the tutorial leaves out is the use of an array to check if the hair colour is either black or brown.</p>

<h3>Applying CodeQL to Detect Simple XSS</h3>
<p>Now I will code up a very simple ReactJS web application to take some text and make it do whacky CrAzY things like go all uppercase, switch between capitalised and non-capitalised, and space text out with a space for each letter, isn't that a m a z i n g?! (Y-Combinator, hit me up!). Alas, some security nerd a cubicle over was telling me that silly React devs sometimes set <code>DangerouslySetInnerHTML</code> which can lead to XSS. This is the perfect place to write a graphql predicate to check for inputs. The basic XSS string <code>&lt;img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)></code> should work in conjunction to the <code>LowerCaseTextForm</code> React Component.</p>

<p>I understand that one could just search this string, but what if we wanted to check other things like DoS sliding scale enabled for inputs that create POST requests? Or all controller functions that don't have an <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute on all admin dashboard endpoints? CodeQL is all about building a query library for all potential code patterns which is less of a generic SAST scan, and more of a tailored smoke alarm that tells you exactly which type of food is on fire.</p>

<img src="../images/react_components.png"/>
<img src="../images/react_app.png"/>

<p>The above shows our PoC ready to get rolling for CodeQL analysis (Don't shot me, I'm not a frontend developer). The application will be up on GitHub under the repo:<a href="https://github.com/TheBigStonk/CodeQL-PoC-XSS-App">https://github.com/TheBigStonk/CodeQL-PoC-XSS-App</a></p>

<p>So now that we have the application all set up under a GitHub repo, let's start doing some CodeQL analysis on the repository. We'll prepare this by following the documentation at <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/preparing-your-code-for-codeql-analysis">https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/preparing-your-code-for-codeql-analysis</a>, with this including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start with creating a codeql db to analyse with <code>codeql database create codeql-db --language=javascript-typescript</code> being run at the repository root.</li>
    <li>Run the query: <code>codeql database analyze --download codeql-db codeql/javascript-queries:Declarations/UnusedVariable.ql --format=csv --output=js-results.csv --rerun</code></li>
</ul>

<img src="../images/unused_variables.png"/>
<p>What do you know! Although we were just worried about XSS, the <b>UnusedVariable.ql</b> query that comes with <code>codeql/javascript-queries:Declarations/UnusedVariable.ql</code> actually found that there was unused <code>var</code>'s in both <code>index.js</code> and the SpaceyTextForm React component! We'll add this into our repo as another commit to showcase this.</p>

<p>This isn't what we wanted however, we want to write and run our own XSS detecting custom <code>ql</code> check to apply on the codeql database. We'll start by creating the file <code>DetectDangerouslySetInnerHTML.ql</code>, by far we want to click the add query button as shown within the CodeQL extension in order to have the codeql pack file created for us (manually is a hassle and can be error prone).</p>

<img src="../images/custom_codeql_query.png"/>

<p>At this point my codepack looks like:</p>

<samp>
    --- <br>
    library: false <br>
    warnOnImplicitThis: false <br>
    name: getting-started/javascript-queries-javascript <br>
    version: 1.0.0 <br>
    dependencies: <br>
    codeql/javascript-all: ^2.1.0 <br>
</samp>

<p>After this we want to begin adding the following metadata codeblock to our QL query (further reading at <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/">https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/</a>):</p>

<samp>
    /** <br>
    * @name Use of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML property within an application<br>
    * @description Without justification dangerouslySetInnerHTML can be abused to inject javascript and enabled reflected XSS<br>
    * @kind problem<br>
    * @problem.severity recommendation<br>
    * @id js/detect-dangerouslySetInnerHTML<br>
    * @tags maintainability<br>
    * @precision high<br>
    */
</samp>

<p>Now that our metadata is established, we need to import javascript into the QL file, and then write a basic from/where/select to check for the use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute. Notice how we are facilitated through JsxAttribute to only look at the JSX dangerouslySetInnerHTML, CodeQL can be hyperfocused on it's detection mechanisms:</p>

<samp>
    import javascript<br>
    <br>
    from JsxAttribute attr<br>
    where attr.getName() = "dangerouslySetInnerHTML"<br>
    select attr, "Avoid using dangerouslySetInnerHTML as it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities."
</samp>

<p>Finally, rerun codeql with the command from within the <code>codeql-custom-queries-javascript</code> folder that was generated (notice I am seperating my csv output from the previous unused variable codeql query we imported remotely): <code>codeql database analyze ../codeql-db --format=csv --output=custom-js-results.csv --rerun DetectDangerouslySetInnerHTML.ql</code></p>

<img src="../images/run_custom_queries.png"/>

<p>As you can see, the custom CodeQL query was effective in finding the specific React component that contained the specific XSS vulnerability marker that we were after.</p>

<h3>Conclusion and Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>When starting CodeQL, I thought it would be an in-and-out tool for play with in one hour. Looking deeper between the CLI, local database creation, pack files, predicates, and the vast ecosystem of queries, I can definitely see this as quickly becoming my defacto SAST tool suite.</p>

<p>Some additional queries that we could build out in the future include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Checking for DTD parsing that indicates processes that could expose XXE on old repo's that use XML.</li>
    <li>Password reset functionality validated for bruteforce protections.</li>
    <li>Add some more custom queries like compute synchronous functions prior to authentication check applied (i.e., time-based enumeration).</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall this whole piece has been very eye-opening, and a wake up call to improve the static code analysis side to vulnerability identification.</p>
