title: PHP Type Juggling Vulnerabilities</p>
<hr />
<p>As with all good identification of poor application security, the devil is in the details (unless of course the security issues derives from poor design or logic, which in that case the devil is already there to stay and there is little you can do except burn the application). Without digressing too much however, we will look at an interesting but potentially costly vulnerability in PHP development commonly seen where equals comparisons are used instead of the more appropriate strict comparison, to which a PHP variable type juggling vulnerability can propogate leading to potential login bypass and breaking logic of search and comparison functions that exist in the application being examined.</p>
<p>In PHP, there are two main comparison modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal PHP comparison: ==</li>
<li>Identical PHP comparison: ===</li>
</ul>
<p>According to PHP documentation, the Equal operator allows for checking if two values are equal after type juggling, whereas the identical comparison operator checks they are of the same type, regardless of type juggling. This is referred to strict vs loose comparisons.</p>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/comparison_operator_type_info.png" /></p>
<p>PHP does not require explicit type definition. Similar to var in JavaScript it is determined by the context of the variables it is storing and using (e.g., $foo = 1 is an integer variable, while $foo = "1" is a string variable).</p>
<p>Because of type juggling and loose comparisons, it is possible to trick an auth check or other comparison into doing something with a weird comparison juggling trick. The following example wile help to understand this concept.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Let's look at the following auth code:</p>
<p><code>if($_GET['login']=="1"){
    // Note: An Equal strcmp() will return 0
    if(strcmp($_POST['user'], "admin") == 0 &amp;&amp; strcmp($_POST['password'], "quantumbucks") == 0){
      echo "Welcome hacker";
    }else{
      echo "lol no";
    }</code></p>
<p>It looks okay, until you realise that how this is taking in the password and username we send in the request, If we look at the table below, we should note that if we modified the request password="" in Burp Suite to password[]="". We then send in this array to compare against a string, strcmp() throws a null, and loosely compared to the 0 ends up being True and letting up in. This comparison has been highlighted in the table.</p>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/comparison_operator_type_table.png" /></p>
<p>Example Fix:</p>
<p>Let's rewrite this code:</p>
<p><code>if($_GET['login']=="1"){
    // Note: An Equal strcmp() will return 0
    if(strcmp($_POST['user'], "admin") === 0 &amp;&amp; strcmp($_POST['password'], "quantumbucks") === 0){
      echo "Welcome hacker";
    }else{
      echo "lol no";
    }</code></p>
<p>As you can see here, using strict comparison operators would prevent the list being passed in. The strcmp() function would return NULL, and when compared to the 0 would show as... False.</p>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/comparison_operator_type_table2.png" /></p>
<p>The following type juggling example only talks to breaking strcmp() and utilising this create a bypass. More creative methods could also be implemented, especially where functions have been made by developers.</p>
