title: THM - BountyHunter Walkthrough</p>
<hr />
<p>Hey all, Happy New Year üçæüçæüçæ I hope everything has been going well for you all. 2022 looks like it is shaping up to be an amazing year for cybersecurity, from trends in people adopting blockchain technologies and buzzwords, to an ever-growing threat of supplychain-related vulnerabilites on software (One only need look at Log4J). With such complexity it is nice to sometimes have a casual box to tinker away at. That casual box is Bountyhunter.This box can be found <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/cowboyhacker">here</a></p>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_intro.png" /> </p>
<p>The following requires you to run a Linux distribution and have a TryHackMe account. Once that is all done you can connect to the VPN to access the THM network and with the machine spun up you should have an IP for Bountyhunter to get started.</p>
<p>We will start with a basic Nmap scan to enumerate ports. You could use Rustscan or masscan however sometimes it's best to keep it simple.</p>
<p>The command syntax we will be using is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 [IP_ADDRESS] -oN initial_scan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this command does is scan the first thousand ports (you can specify more with the '-p' tag). The <strong>-sC</strong> stands for default scripts, the <strong>-sV</strong> enumerates for versions, and the <strong>-T4</strong> is a speed flag. The <strong>-oN</strong> then outputs the scan to a file so we can reference this again. Note that if you don't get the results shown below that is because:
1. You aren't connected to the network properly
2. Your scan command is not correct
3. You may have an underlying error in identification of the server, try more scans!</p>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_nmap.png" /></p>
<p>Now highlighting the important stuff here we notice that FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is running with anonymous access enabled, which basically means that you can access the FTP share by setting your name when you login with the username 'anonymous', the other two points to note is that you also have HTTP 80 open so there is a website running, and SSH 22 which is a Secure Shell remote access protocol. We could take a look at 80, or enumerate users on 22. For now though we will just login anonymously to 21 and pull all the files we can using the following syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ftp [IP_ADDRESS]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once logged in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ls
cd [DIRECTORY_TO_CHANGE]
GET [FILENAME]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_ftp.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we used some additional commands not discussed. A more full list can be found <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/ftp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Viewing the text files, we notice we have a note from <em>lin</em>, and a credential list. Based upon the questions in the room we can assume we have everything to get the user and root flag.</p>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_ftp.png" /></p>
<p>If you remember before, we stated that we have 22 SSH for remote login and management open as a port on the machine, we could assume there is a <em>lin</em> user on the box, and that one of those passwords in that list might belong to <em>lin</em>. We can test this with a quick bruteforce attack using hydra. If you don't know hydra you can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra">here</a>.</p>
<p>The command syntax to perform this attack is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.152.130 ssh</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_ssh.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see. We are now successfully in the machine by bruteforcing lin's password and performing an SSH connection to confirm the results of the hydra script. At this point a quick look on the machine while give you the user.txt flag for the machine. Now to target root.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to escalate privileges on a machine once you have some user access. However we will check which command the user can run as root using sudo (short for super user do). The command to check this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -l</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_check.png" /></p>
<p>Sudo privileges can be dangerous. From our check we noticed that we are able to run tar as a root user. Going to GTFObins, a site dedicated to privesc using bin programs on the machine we can see there is a <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/">privilege escalation using tar with sudo</a>. The tar command they recommend to run runs the bash command to give us the shell using the -I flag, which filters data (in this case /dev/null) through a command. I won't bore you with the other commands however I implore you to deconstruct the shell privesc using tar as sudo. Note we are using the command for GNU tar. We can check this is infact GNU tar on the machine by checking the <strong>--help</strong> flag.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tar xf /dev/null -I '/bin/sh -c "sh &lt;&amp;2 1&gt;&amp;2"'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="_config.yml" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/bountyhunter_root.png" /></p>
<p>And there we have it. I hope you learned something here. This was an easy box with straightforward escalations and enumeration without any rabbit-holes. However I do implore you to note the methodology is important to know when you are stuck and how to test everything. As someone who has had a realisation in 2022, I have come to understand CTFs if anything teach attention to detail and leaving no stone unturned, every failed command or privesc is just more information around what does and doesn't work.</p>
<p>Happy hunting out there ya'll ü§ô</p></body>
