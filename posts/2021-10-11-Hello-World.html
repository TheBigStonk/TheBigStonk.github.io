title: Here we go again</p>
<hr />
<p>The purpose of this blog is to revamp and start up again a blog in order to improve my understanding of security while at the same time improving my knowledge of the art of security.</p>
<p>Much like the words of the great philosopher Carl "CJ" Johnson of San Andreas, we are indeed... Going again:

<p>I chose Jekyll Now because of a few reasons:
- Jekyll was recommended ages ago;
- Easier to setup than standard Jekyll; and
- I take notes with Obsidian, therefore the more Markdown I can consume and use the better.</p>
<p>The reason why it is on Github Pages:
- I trust their sys admins over my hosting;
- I like the fact it's free; and
- The CDN is impressive and the speed of this site with it's basic components is lovely.</p>
<p>For more information on the Jekyll Now and the Jekyll project, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>For more cybersecurity stuff. Stay tuned.</p></body>
