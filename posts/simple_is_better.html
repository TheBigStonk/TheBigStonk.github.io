<h2>- Simple is Better -</h2>
<h3> 1st December 2022 </h3>

<hr>

<p> Welcome everyone. I would like to introduce the following website to you all the new and improved blog for Maxwell
    Francis 2022 before the end of the year.</p>
<p> Many would argue this looks like something out of 1997, and as a response they would be dead right. What I have
    build is a blog compiled via Static Site Generation with my own custom python tool, and deployed to GitHub Pages so
    I don't have to spend a dollar.</p>
<p> What this is not is a convoluted WordPress source code cacophony, or a buy a site wrapper like WIX or Squarespace.
    There is no Javascript, there is no CSS, there might be images sometimes however I hardly need them except to make
    my ramblings more understandable sometimes.</p>

<h3>Benefits to the new approach (over a generic Jekyll blog):</h3>
<p> Honestly there is a ton however the main reasons why broken down by S.U.U.S.S are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Super fast: </b>Honestly this thing is like a Formula One constructor with it's speed. This is achieved
        via both using GitHub's infrastructure which uses Varnish for caching and Fastly for Content Delivery Networking
        (CDN). Using Solarwinds'
        Pingdom Website Speed test I am getting:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>181ms for North America - USA - San Francisco</li>
        <li>221ms for Europe - United Kingdom - London</li>
        <li>254ms for Asia - Japan - Tokyo</li>
        <li>320ms for Pacific - Australia - Sydney</li>
        <a><i>*I understand I haven't evidenced this to you all, so if you don't trust me I encourage you to run a test
                yourself at <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com">tools.pingdom.com</a>.</i></a>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <b>Unique:</b> I feel like a complete and utter hipster making this site in the best way. I wrote a tool called
        <b><i>Baboon</i></b> I briefly described at the start that takes my monkey man ideas, and converts the markdown
        into HTML. I then use a script to
        branch a new article, I go have a coffee, and if I come back and agree with what I write, I push it out to
        master branch. Every man and his dog has a WordPress, Jekyll, or Blogger, but I am the only one at the time of
        writing with a
        <b><i>Baboon</i></b>-driven, static HTML-only blog.
    </li>
    <li><b>Understandable:</b> I know this site. I have a rough inclination where the servers are, I know how it is
        generated, I know what is on it (hardly any), what cookies and local storage is used (none), and even the total
        size of the site down to the kb. Many dynamic platforms don't have this advantage.
    </li>
    <li><b>Secure: </b> I have done a lot of work with web application security for accounting systems and handling
        bug
        bounties. One of the most telling indicators on security vulnerability potential is complexity and attack
        surface. A common principle security staff fail to realise or admit is that the more technology and bloat
        you
        introduce into a platform or system, the more likely there is to be an issue that can be exploited. Very
        simple
        well understood systems beat out complex black boxes. That said I still need to ensure my simple system is
        well
        protected. And to do this I have MFA, SSL, I have DNS security flags set and have my domain set far out to
        prevent malicious renewal, I have alerting, a plan to migrate which can be deployed over in one click to <a
            href="https://surge.sh">surge.sh</a>. I actually fully encourage any security researchers to hack this
        site.
        I will pay you if you do, I'll put a <i>security.txt</i> up, and we can hash out what a vulnerability will
        cost.
    </li>
    <li><b>Simple:</b> This is a very simple site which makes the content the main focus rather than some silly div
        buttons. There are no Ruby gems or JS library CVE's to worry about. It is a simple platform with
        a simple goal that has been engineered to be the least engineered thing I can build to gracefully achieve my
        goal.</li>
</ul>

<p>What this ultimately will mean is that hopefully the no-framework approach will be the framework I will end up
    sticking with. This is a real less is more approach and either we will see this flop, or a massive splurge of
    articles!</p>
