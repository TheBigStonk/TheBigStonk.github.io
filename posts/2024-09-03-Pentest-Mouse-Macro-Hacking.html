<h2>Pentest Mouse Macros. The What and Why of it</h2>
<h3>3rd September 2023</h3>

<h3>Prompt for the Research</h3>

<p>So currently I have done most of the Offsec PEN-200 Challenge Labs and after much procrastination have the OSCP booked October. While going through my methodology I have been thinking about how I can make my hacking as simple as possible.</p>

<p>This prompted many changes. From a very extensive <a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian.md</a> vault for my notes, Using <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions">zsh-autosuggestions</a>, and recording everything I do. I realised however that this was not enough which led me to thinking out of the box, and think <i>"Okay so you've been a hacker for a while now. How can I take some tricks from other types of 'cheating' and hacking to give myself an edge?"</i>. By cheating, I should add I'm not going to cheat in the exam but instead look for performance boosts. No one said dooping was illegal in CTF ðŸ˜‚</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://gamehacking.academy/pages/4/03/">gamehacking.academy's post on macro hacking</a>. Macro hacking is performing a number of key techniques or inputs on the press of a button or trigger event.</p>

<p>What this sparked was the thought <i>what if I got a gaming mouse, and bound a number of commands to speed up my hacking of machines and improve my performance?</i>. This was the prompt, and from there I went forth to upgrade my pentesting. Powerglove style!</p>

<h3>Mouse Selection and Objectives</h3>
<p>I was looking through a local New Zealand IT megastore (PB Tech), and searched through the list of peripherals. I understand computer mouse/mice/meese can have a number of buttons. For me, I wanted one with lots of accessible buttons that was easy to understand and register. After a bit of careful research, the newly released <b>Razer Naga v2 HyperSpeed Wireless MMO Gaming Mouse</b> (herein known as the <b>Naga</b>) seemed nothing short of perfect!</p>

<p>Through my mouse research. I discoverd that there is a subset of gaming mice called the MMO Gaming Mouse which usually has a numbered keypad on the side. This type of mouse is also used for complex task based games like real-time strategies, however the the general concept is that these mice thrive where you might have 6 different spells in an MMO like World of Warcraft, and shooting them out would be as easy as clicking a button on the side.</p>

<p>I got my Naga for quite cheap due to a deal. And with this came 12 buttons on the side, two next to the left click button, a scroll wheel that could either free-spin or tactile cycle, and had an impressive 30,000 DPI. There is actually 19 programmable buttons but I only wanted to focus on the 1 - 12 keypad.</p>

<p>I had a couple of goals on this research that were:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To have my most common short-cuts in Linux being process suspension (Ctrl+Z), SIGINT/Copy (Ctrl+C), Terminal Copy (Ctrl+Shift+C), PASTE (Ctrl+V ) and Terminal Paste (Ctrl+Shift+V).</li>
    <li>Set up Ligolo-ng proxy server on a tun0 interface</li>
    <li>Run and execute <code>ls</code> on the current terminal</li>
    <li>Start a greenshot capture</li>
    <li>Start a python HTTP Server</li> 
    <li>Type out a default scripts and version scan nmap</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are mathing, you'd realise I'm not using the whole keypad yet. Additionally, none of this is very ambitious. I did want to get into achieving these first as a definition of done. Maybe I'll write another piece later with better macros. For now, I had my Naga at home from the store during lunch and I was ready to get macro-ing</p>

<h3>Initial Macros in Windows</h3>

<p>So as a quik little ramp up to making macros work via Kali Linux and achieve my definition of done, I first looked at how I would make a macro from my Windows. I'll try to make something random which is binding one key to Copy, and another to Paste.</p>

<p>What we need to do this is plug the mouse into our test machine and download one <a href="https://www.razer.com/ap-en/synapse-3">Razer Synapse</a> and utilise the GUI on that to make the dream work.</p>

<p>So I ended up finding the GUI for Synpase which I found highly intuitive. I was able to bind copy/paste to side buttons <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. Razer is not necessarily a champion of opensource software though so I shouldn't get my macro hopes high to have the same experience in the Linux world, especially as Synapse is only available on Windows.</p>

<h3>Setting up my first Macro in Linux</h3>
<p>So I spent an exorbident amount of configuring input-remapper (very good app btw) and slaving away at that only to realise that as I am running a virtual machine, if I fully share USB and Bluetooth devices with the VM, I end up getting the Macros I need.</p>

<p>Since we were all gucci now, I considered this a job well done. Another win in VM > Bare metal Linux users. A couple things to note are that if you press a key down within your macro, you should release that key wihin the same macros. Additionally I found out the hard way adjusting the USB Driver to 3.1 for the VM will break it. Finally, I found that you have to stick to your macros, as they will take a will to convert to muscle memory. Oh one last piece of advice is that you can export your macros to an XML which I highly recommend backing up to your GitHub Account (i.e., I'm keeping mine in a private repo, but also don't embeded sudo creds and then leak that out in your macro export publicly that's dumb). Overall as you can see here I can effectively run stuff pretty quickly, cut, paste, and run commands. I have achieved all the macros from my definition of done, and I can't wait to continue improving hacking effeciencies.</p>
