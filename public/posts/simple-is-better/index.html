What this is not:

A convoluted WordPress codebase
A site-in-a-box wrapper like Wix or Squarespace
JavaScript-heavy or CSS-driven

<p>Many would argue this looks like something out of 1997 — and they would be absolutely right. What I’ve built is a blog compiled via <strong>static site generation</strong>, deployed to <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, and costing me exactly <strong>$0</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-the-new-approach-over-a-generic-jekyll-blog">Benefits of the new approach (over a generic Jekyll blog)</h2>
<p>Honestly, there are many — but the main ones, broken down by <strong>S.U.U.S.S</strong>, are:</p>
<h3 id="super-fast"><strong>Super fast</strong></h3>
<p>This thing is fast — <em>Formula One fast</em>. That’s thanks to GitHub’s infrastructure, Varnish caching, and Fastly CDN.</p>
<p>Using SolarWinds Pingdom Website Speed Test, I get:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>181 ms</strong> — North America (San Francisco)</li>
<li><strong>221 ms</strong> — Europe (London)</li>
<li><strong>254 ms</strong> — Asia (Tokyo)</li>
<li><strong>320 ms</strong> — Pacific (Sydney)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you don’t trust me (fair), run your own test at</em><br>
👉 <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com">https://tools.pingdom.com</a></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="unique"><strong>Unique</strong></h3>
<p>I feel like a full-blown hipster saying this — but I wrote my own tool called <strong><em>Baboon</em></strong>.</p>
<p>It takes my questionable monkey-brain ideas, converts Markdown into HTML, branches a new article, and deploys when I’m happy with it.</p>
<p>Everyone has WordPress, Jekyll, or Blogger.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I’m the only one with a <strong>Baboon-driven, static HTML-only blog</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="understandable"><strong>Understandable</strong></h3>
<p>I know this site.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know where the servers are</li>
<li>I know how it’s generated</li>
<li>I know exactly what’s on it (very little)</li>
<li>I know what cookies and local storage it uses (<strong>none</strong>)</li>
<li>I even know its total size down to the kilobyte</li>
</ul>
<p>That level of understanding is rare with dynamic platforms.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="secure"><strong>Secure</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve spent years doing web application security for accounting systems and handling bug bounties.</p>
<p>One of the strongest indicators of vulnerability is <strong>complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>The more tech, frameworks, plugins, and abstractions you add:
➡️ the larger your attack surface becomes.</p>
<p>Simple, well-understood systems consistently outperform complex black boxes.</p>
<p>That said, this site still has:</p>
<ul>
<li>MFA</li>
<li>SSL</li>
<li>DNS security flags</li>
<li>Long-term domain locking</li>
<li>Alerting</li>
<li>A one-click migration plan to <a href="https://surge.sh">https://surge.sh</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>actively encourage</em> security researchers to hack this site.</p>
<p>If you succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll pay you</li>
<li>I’ll publish a <code>security.txt</code></li>
<li>We’ll agree on bounty value</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="simple"><strong>Simple</strong></h3>
<p>This site exists to serve content — not div soup.</p>
<p>No Ruby gems.<br>
No JavaScript CVEs.<br>
No dependency hell.</p>
<p>Just content, engineered to be <strong>as un-engineered as possible</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>What this ultimately means is that this <strong>no-framework approach may become the framework</strong> I stick with.</p>
<p>Less really is more.</p>
<p>Either this flops…<br>
or you’ll see a <em>lot</em> more articles.</p>
