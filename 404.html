<h1>404 - Page Not found</h1>
<p>The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
    not find a current representation for the target resource or is not
    willing to disclose that one exists. A 404 status code does not
    indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or
    permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the
    origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that
    the condition is likely to be permanent.</p>

<p>A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
    indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see <a
        href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7234#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]</a>).</p>
