The purpose of this blog is to revamp and start up again a blog in order to improve my understanding of security while at the same time improving my knowledge of the art of security.

Much like the words of the great philosopher Carl "CJ" Johnson of San Andreas, we are indeed... Going again:

I chose Jekyll Now because of a few reasons:
- Jekyll was recommended ages ago;
- Easier to setup than standard Jekyll; and
- I take notes with Obsidian, therefore the more Markdown I can consume and use the better.

The reason why it is on Github Pages:
- I trust their sys admins over my hosting;
- I like the fact it's free; and
- The CDN is impressive and the speed of this site with it's basic components is lovely.

For more information on the Jekyll Now and the Jekyll project, head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

For more cybersecurity stuff. Stay tuned.
